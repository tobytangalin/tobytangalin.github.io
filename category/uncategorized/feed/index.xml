<p>Thank you for joining us on this special day! The action starts at Frederiksberg Town Hall at 11:30 AM on August 21 (Saturday).  </p>



<p>Here is a quick summary of the day:</p>



<ol><li>Wedding Ceremony</li><li>Lunch</li><li>Canal Tour (optional)</li><li>Exclusive After-party (optional) </li></ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Wedding Ceremony at Frederiksberg Town Hall (11:30 AM &#8211; 12:30 NN)</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="640" height="413" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/234850694_885306922193175_3693194927946849938_n.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-712" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/234850694_885306922193175_3693194927946849938_n.jpg 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/08/234850694_885306922193175_3693194927946849938_n-300x194.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure>



<p>Our wedding ceremony is scheduled at 11:30 AM, however, it may be slightly delayed depending on the preceding weddings and if the officiator has slept through his alarm. So please be there by 11: 20 AM. If you want to come a bit earlier, you can find us a stone&#8217;s throw away at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7x2AnznzoD5XDJLHA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Allegade 25C</a>.   </p>



<ul><li>Dress code: smart casual</li><li><s>Last time we checked, there is a limit of 25 people allowed in the wedding hall. Unless the regulations have changed, the children (or sacrificial volunteers) may have to wait outside during the ceremony.</s> Update: the capacity limit has been lifted, so everyone can join in the ceremony! PTL!</li><li>Please take a COVID-19 (rapid, PCR, or antibody) test within the 48 hours prior to the wedding for everyone&#8217;s safety and peace of mind.  </li></ul>

<p>Once the wedding ceremony activity has concluded, it is a short 140 meter walk from the Town Hall to our post-ceremony lunch location at Junior. </p>



<ul><li>We will be serving a five-course lunch menu with free-flowing drinks: Italian welcome bubbles, wine, beer, soft drinks, and coffee. </li><li>Our reservation is from 12:30 noon until 3:30 PM.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Tmf7kRjTzV5f2YoA6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Copenhagen Canal Tour</a> (~4:00 PM &#8211; 5:30 PM)</h2>



<p>After lunch, we&#8217;ll head over to Copenhagen&#8217;s lovely canals for a majestic hour-long boat tour! The timing may be slightly delayed depending the lines, since we cannot book for a specific time on weekends. Participation is optional but please let us know if you want to join.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Spontaneous After-party (6 PM until you drop)</h2>



<p>If your schedule is free and you want to party on, we might go to the park to chill or hang out in our backyard depending on the weather. Simple food and drinks may be provided. We will play this by ear and go with the flow, so expect the unexpected.  </p>

<p>  </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Observations</h2>



<p><strong>Level 9 was not the main priority.</strong> Only 25% of the Top 4 boards reached level 9, and 3 of the 5 games were won by level 8 boards. Bertasaurus&#8217; Wukong 3 and Spencer&#8217;s Zed 3 enabled them to hit 9 and win their games. </p>



<p><strong>Best Early-Mid Game Mystic Duo?</strong> Yumi + Janna. If you only have space for 1, you generally play Yumi unless you are playing an Enlightened comp. You can take out Janna and put in Zilean later. </p>



<p>Add the <strong>Divine Duelist Duo</strong> (Jax and Lee Sin) to provide late game power to the Bonkey Kong.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Executioner Kayle was the most popular comp in the Top 4, but there was a healthy number of other comps. Zed can still win games, Ninja Assassins can win games, and Bonkey can still win games! Slayer and Elderwood Mage comps nearly won games too. Reroll Warlord, Brawler, and even a Nasus Syphoner comp managed to Top 4, so don&#8217;t hard force Kayle just yet. </p>



<p>Keep in mind that most of the tournament participants are flex players, meaning they play comps based on what units they hit. Blindly forcing these comps may help you reach a certain rank, but please continue to look for more resources on other elements of the game: playing the early game, positioning, flexing, etc. Happy climbing!  </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Does a Free TFT Tournament Work?</h2>



<p>After you&#8217;ve joined the tournament&#8217;s Discord server, you can check out some of their channels to learn about the specific rules and tournament format. Some tournaments such as Nicecactus are run through the website and do not use a Discord server.</p>



<p>Tournaments generally follow this format:</p>



<ol><li>  <strong>The Check-in </strong><ul><li>Write your in-game name in the <em><strong>#check-in</strong></em> channel (usually an hour before the tournament starting time).</li></ul></li><li> <strong>The Check-in closes and lobbies are generated</strong><ul><li>Open your game client now! If there is a lobby leader, wait for them to invite you. If there is no lobby leader, wait for someone to invite you or create the lobby yourself.</li><li>Once everyone is ready, the games begin!</li></ul></li><li><strong>After the first game</strong><ul><li>If you&#8217;ve won your lobby, you should post a screenshot of the result in the <strong><em>#match-report</em></strong> channel. </li><li>Wait for the next game (if there is one).</li></ul></li></ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">General tips and info:</h3>



<ul><li>You will need to create an account on the server where the tournament is being played.</li><li>Leaving a tournament mid-way through could result in a ban from future tournaments. <strong>Be sure to PM the tournament moderator with your reasoning if you really must exit early.</strong></li><li>Tournaments are often frequented by Challenger and Grandmaster players. This is a great chance to try to defeat them! <sub>Spoiler alert, you probably won&#8217;t, but it will be a good learning experience.</sub></li><li>Lobbies are randomly generated.</li><li>Some tournaments may require you to fill out an additional form.</li></ul>



<p>I&#8217;ve really enjoying playing in these community-run tournaments over the past few months, and I hope you will too.</p>



<p>If you run any free tournament and would like to see it added here, please let me know in the comments section.</p>

<p>The TFT <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/844577004" target="_blank">NA Regional Qualifier Finals</a> featured some of the best NA challengers in the game. Let&#8217;s take a look at their strongest compositions and the most popular items. We&#8217;ll find out what the best carry items and utility items are.  </p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Top 4&#8217;s compositions</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/10.25-top-4-comps.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/10.25-top-4-comps-1024x683.png" alt="" class="wp-image-558" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/10.25-top-4-comps-1024x683.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/10.25-top-4-comps-300x200.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/10.25-top-4-comps-768x512.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/10.25-top-4-comps.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Adept, Dusk, and Elderwood dominated the Top 4.</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Elderwood </h4>



<p>In Game 5, <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.twitch.tv/setsukotft" target="_blank">Setsuko</a> ran Chosen Mage Lulu with double Chalice until level 9, then grabbed a Chosen Ahri for 3 Mage (Lilia) and a ton of 5-costs to win the game.</strong> Elderwood seems to be fairly strong throughout the entire game and can utilize a wide variety of Chosen Elderwood champions. </p>



<p>Common approaches include:</p>



<ul><li>6 Elderwood + 3 Mage (Chosen Elderwood/Elderwood Mage required). Slow rolling at level 7 for 3-star Veigar, Lulu, or Annie. </li><li>Elderwood Brawler (Sunfire Cape highly recommended) with Hunters. (Ashe with Giant Slayer)</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.metatft.com/guides/elderwood-veigar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elderwood Veigar guide by Challenger Tiaan</a></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Dusk </h4>



<p>Dusk was played in several different ways: </p>



<ul><li><strong>Playing Warlord early, then transitioning into Dusk at level 8.</strong> This is probably the most common route to playing Dusk. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.twitch.tv/robinsongz" target="_blank">Robinsongz</a> won 2 games this way. Jarvan or Garen can hold your Riven items (Sunfire Cape, Bramble Vest), Katarina holds your Yone/Sett/Kayn items (HoJ, Gunblade), and Nidalee holds your Jhin items (Giant Slayer, HoJ).  </li><li><strong>Slow rolling for 3-star Vayne.</strong> Chosen Vayne with Rageblade is required. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.twitch.tv/mismatchedsocksss" target="_blank">Mismatched Socks</a> played Fortune Dusk early and filled out his comp with Sej, Yummi, and Jinx for the Vanguard, Mystic, and Sharpshooter synergies.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveTFT/comments/klxeun/jlee7x2s_gm_3030_dusk_30_win_rate_dusk_guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dusk guide by GM JLEE7x2</a></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Adept</h4>



<p>Flexible play is the name of the game when it comes to Adept. There are only three core units to this composition: Yone, Shen, and Irelia. This means that you will have 5 or 6 additional units to flex in. We saw several Adept comps take a Top 4:</p>



<ul><li>Adept + Legendary units (5 costs) <strong>x 3</strong></li><li>Adept + Divine Hunter <strong>x 2</strong></li><li>Adept + Mystic Vanguard (Chosen)    </li></ul>



<p>Adept + Legendaries was the most common route to Top 4, however, <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.twitch.tv/itskace" target="_blank">Kci</a> managed to nab a second place with a comp that felt reminiscent of Set 3.</strong> He picked up an early Chosen Enlightened Fiora and played 4 Enlightened + Jax for the Duelist and Divine synergies. At level 6, he added Kindred and Yumi for the Mystic and Spirit synergies. At level 8, he found a Chosen Vanguard Sej, swapped out Jax, and added Yone, Shen, and Zilean. He stayed at level 8 to roll for 2-star Yone and Zilean, as well as Kindred 3. He was eventually beaten by Mismatched Socks&#8217; Dusk Vayne comp.     </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Other Comps</h4>



<p>The other comps that managed to Top 4 were: Divine, Moonlight Hunters (Aphelios + Sylas), a 5-cost comp, and Vanguard Sharpshooters.  </p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Top 4&#8217;s most popular AD items</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/top-4s-top-AD-items.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/top-4s-top-AD-items-1024x683.png" alt="" class="wp-image-560" width="871" height="580" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/top-4s-top-AD-items-1024x683.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/top-4s-top-AD-items-300x200.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/top-4s-top-AD-items-768x512.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/top-4s-top-AD-items.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 871px) 100vw, 871px" /></a></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hand of Justice and Giant Slayer are the go-to items for your carry.</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Hand of Justice was the most built offensive item because it is a strong item for both AD and AP carries.</strong> Vayne, Aphelios, Veigar, Kindred, Ashe, Jhin, Yone, Sett, and Kayn are just some of the champions that can effectively utilize HoJ. <strong>45% damage amplification or 45% healing of all damage dealt by its user, makes it a very strong item.</strong> </li><li><strong>Giant Slayer</strong> <strong>has seen a resurgence in popularity in recent patches due to the rise of 5-cost comps.</strong> With Belt items, many 5-cost units are over the 1750 HP threshold (Sett and Lee Sin without items) which triggers the 90% additional damage. <strong>Giant Slayer also works well against the high HP of Warlords, 4-star Aphelios, Elderwood Brawlers, and Galio. </strong>Jhin, Ashe, Aphelios, and Vayne love this item. </li><li><strong>Rageblade</strong> <strong>enables &#8220;Carry Vayne&#8221; to deal huge damage over long fights and is usually prioritized first.</strong>  It is also a decent item for Ashe, Aphelios, and Kindred. </li><li><strong>Last Whisper and Infinity Edge are still potent damage items, however, it seems that they were not on the shopping list today.</strong> Some Challenger and GM players still prefer Infinity Edge on Jhin and Ashe.        </li></ul>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Top 4&#8217;s most popular utility items</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-4s-utility-items-1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-4s-utility-items-1-1024x683.png" alt="" class="wp-image-561" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-4s-utility-items-1-1024x683.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-4s-utility-items-1-300x200.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-4s-utility-items-1-768x512.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-4s-utility-items-1.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Preserve HP and Win Streaks with Locket and Sunfire Cape.</h3>



<ul><li>Your carry can only hold 3 items. Zeke&#8217;s and Chalice can increase the power of your carry by buffing your team&#8217;s attack speed and spell power. Locket increases the effective HP of your team. <strong>In early rounds, a small HP difference or several additional auto attacks can often decide the round. </strong></li><li><strong>Sunfire Cape and Locket were the most built items in game-winning comps (60% of the time).</strong> Sunfire Cape is great for taking down that 2-star Tahm or Hecarim. Riven, Jarvan, Vanguards, Brawler-heavy comps, and other tanky champs benefit greatly from the max HP percent pure damage of Sunfire Cape. </li><li><strong>Chalice usually ends up on Lilia or Zilean to help them get off their potentially game-changing skills</strong>. Zzrot components are more likely to be used to build Zeke&#8217;s and Giant Slayer/Rageblade.      </li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Elderwood, Dusk, and Adept-based comps are strong. Use Warlords to transition into Dusk. Elderwood can transition into a 5-cost comp at level 9. HoJ and Giant Slayer are very strong items for your carry. Sunfire Cape and Lockets win games by helping you to preserve HP and win streaks. Think about boosting your carry&#8217;s power further with Zeke&#8217;s and Chalice.</p>



<p><strong>Only half (10/20) of the Top 4 went to level 9.</strong> You don’t always need to aim for level 9 especially if your board isn’t strong. <strong>In both games 1 and 2, there was only a single level 9 player in the Top 4. </strong>However, 4 out of 5 games were won by a level 9 player. </p>



<p>If you are also interested in participating in some tournaments yourself, <a href="/free-tft-tournaments/">I have compiled a list of free, community-run TFT tournaments.</a> </p>



<p>I hope this can help you on your climb to the top. If you have any questions, critiques, or suggestions, please let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Iniko and I&#8217;ve been challenger in every set so far and have peaked 1k+ LP in set 3 and am currently at my peak rank at rank 5. </p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been seeing some guides come up recently on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveTFT/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this subreddit</a> about how to use chosen units and how to play certain comps, but I think something should be said about what units you should look out for early game as well. For this tier list, I&#8217;ve decided to focus on units that I try to play for the strongest board possible. Keep in mind this is also all pre-wolves. </p>



<p>I&#8217;m going to go in depth here about each unit specifically giving my own little blurb about them. I&#8217;ll also link some example strong board combinations with proper synergies and chosen units. </p>



<p>One disclaimer: Everything here is my own personal opinion on how I see the game. You shouldn&#8217;t take these guides as gospel, but try to coordinate these tips with your own play, and listen to other players as well! I love learning from my peers and I&#8217;ll shout some lesser-known really good players out at the end of this guide.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/mRciFF8.png" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">SSS Tier</h2>



<p><strong>Janna</strong>: One of the best units in the entire game I think. I&#8217;m shocked she&#8217;s not getting nerfed as I think she&#8217;s strong at all stages and should only be replaced by Zilean 2 in most comps. Getting an early Janna with a Vanguard, Cultist, Brawler, or chosen Yasuo opener is an instant winstreak. I always take chosen mystic Janna unless I&#8217;m trying to force some meme build.</p>



<p><strong>Thresh</strong>: Also one of the best units at all stages mostly due to his synergies. Extremely flexible unit that you can play in multiple comps with versatile positioning. Early game I like putting my Thresh right behind two stacked frontliners, or right next to my main frontliner so the shield hits 2-3 units. Always pick up an early chosen Thresh. Vanguard lets you go Ahri and Dusk lets you go Riven. I can go more into detail about this kind of decision making in a different guide/in other comments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">SS Tier</h2>



<p><strong>J4</strong>: Very good coupled with cultist if you have Elise as Keeper is super strong early game and he himself does a surprising amount of damage. Can hold items for Riven.</p>



<p><strong>Kindred</strong>: Extremely good chosen that can streak you to level 7 or even 8. Even taking 1 cost Kindred isn&#8217;t bad as long as you have items for her, but I probably wouldn&#8217;t play it as 1 cost without items over something like Akali. Can hold Ahri or Ashe items.</p>



<p><strong>Akali</strong>: Naturally strong with Ninja buff, even better if you get her chosen. Sometimes she gets stuck on units in a weird way so for that reason I think she&#8217;s marginally worse than Kindred, but if she has Blue Buff and an AP item she can streak you really hard, chosen or not. I usually use her to hold Ahri items.</p>



<p><strong>Nunu</strong>: Naturally you&#8217;re most likely going to go Ashe if you find this guy before wolves. Outfit him with tank items. If you aren&#8217;t finding brawlers you can always use him as your Riven.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">S Tier</h2>



<p><strong>Pyke</strong>: Enables cultist but still very good as a standalone unit. Chosen Pyke assassin is extremely good as is Cultist for obvious reasons. He can hold Ahri items or Jhin items if you get a Dusk spat to put on him early. Also isn&#8217;t bad with Sunfire Cape as he spreads it to everyone, but I like putting that on my beefy boys in the front.</p>



<p><strong>Kennen</strong>: Obvious choice to pair with Elise in a Cultist comp early game. The only reason he&#8217;s below J4 is that it&#8217;s not as easy to 2 star him and he can often die without ulting. Sticking a GA on him is a great idea.</p>



<p><strong>Zed</strong>: Pair him with Evelynn and he&#8217;s a monster. Same logic for why he&#8217;s above Eve: easier to 2 star and easier to find his chosen early game.</p>



<p><strong>Maoki</strong>: Extremely tanky when outfitted with Sunfire Cape and 2 starred. Better if chosen. Better if chosen brawler. His spell rules. Not much else to say here.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Tier</h2>



<p><strong>Elise</strong>: Solid frontline unit for cultists, very very good Sunfire Cape holder.</p>



<p><strong>Diana</strong>: Really debated on where to put Diana but I think A tier is fine with her as unless you&#8217;re going moonlight reroll, you&#8217;ll end up selling her chosen anyway. Chosen assassin enables 4 assassin cultist early on which is quite underrated and chosen Moonlight lets you play a myriad of strong boards. She can also solo 1-2 just like in set 2.</p>



<p><strong>Garen</strong>: Reliable unit, good with Sunfire Cape and 2 starred, decent overall until mid stage 3 typically.</p>



<p><strong>Wukong</strong>: Divine &gt; Vanguard for chosen. He can hold dps items or tank items for whatever you transition to. I think Bonkey Kong is pretty overrated, but if you want to play it BiS is probably RFC HoJ +1 (maybe QSS/BT/IE/etc. depending on game) Using him with cultist opener bumps him to S tier.</p>



<p><strong>Yasuo</strong>: Extremely strong if chosen, still pretty strong if not. Holds items well just like monkey and you can play quite a few openers around him. My only issue with him is he baits people into going for duelist slowroll which I don&#8217;t think is very good. Use him as an item holder and you&#8217;re solid. Same with monkey, using him with a cultist opener bumps him up to S tier.</p>



<p><strong>Tahm Kench</strong>: UNLOAD THE TOAD OSFrog UNBENCH THE KENCH OSFrog (really good as a solo tank even, Sunfire Cape Kench will outdps your carries, chosen brawler Kench owns. Not higher because without Sunfire he&#8217;s kind of just a sponge.)</p>



<p><strong>Vi</strong>: Heavily underrated unit in my opinion. Vi 2/Chosen Vi can hold any items and if she doesn&#8217;t winstreak you, you won&#8217;t ever take much damage. I like Brawler Vi more than Warlord Vi for chosen.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">B Tier</h2>



<p><strong>Lissandra</strong>: Can streak you pretty hard with chosen moonlight for a free 3 cost or just plain strong board, pretty underwhelming otherwise IMO until she has a mana/AP item. Can hold items for Ahri really well.</p>



<p><strong>Kat</strong>: Pretty heckin good if you can get her to cast ever. She&#8217;s cleanup crew for a tanky team.</p>



<p><strong>Eve</strong>: Not a bad unit by any means but I usually use her as a synergy bot and if she gets more than 1 kill I&#8217;m happy. Power goes way up at 2 stars though.</p>



<p><strong>Sylas</strong>: Beefy frontline Moonlight dude man guy. Up so high because his spell is really good and enables a few strong boards with Brawler or Moonlight options.</p>



<p><strong>Lulu</strong>: Also debated on this one but she can definitely have some clutch moments with an early Elderwood synergy coupled with her spell. Not a bad unit but I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d pick her up as chosen unless I was playing some mage meme comp, and even then it&#8217;s a maybe.</p>



<p><strong>Jinx</strong>: Enables sharpshooter, solid stun, if you get her early she&#8217;s eh. Give her Shojin and it&#8217;s better. Her chosen can streak you with items but I haven&#8217;t seen it do much without items.</p>



<p><strong>Fiora</strong>: Heavily underrated unit, I will unironically consider picking up a chosen Fiora and having her hold items. Only in B tier because you never want to keep her and her synergies don&#8217;t enable much but as a standalone unit she&#8217;s pretty good at 2 star. Stop calling her garbage <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>Annie</strong>: Can definitely fit into an already strong comp if you roll her as your chosen. I wouldn&#8217;t really play her otherwise, but she&#8217;s not the worst by any means. Give her Riven items or try to 3 star her for some fun (8th place) gameplay.</p>



<p><strong>Twisted Fate</strong> (I think?): Obvious choice for cultists, 2 star does some great damage, overall just solid reliable unit. Give him Ahri items. Seriously could not tell if this image was Jhin or TF.</p>



<p><strong>Yuumi</strong>: The absolute GOD CARRY later in the game for many comps. Seriously don&#8217;t underestimate this cat. I like her early game for mystic paired with Janna, plus her spell owns. In other situations, she is a bit underwhelming until later though.</p>



<p><strong>Irelia</strong>: Not the worst but not the best. Even getting her as chosen is kind of&#8230; meh. She can probably streak you but I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s worth the investment because of the synergies. Open to having my mind changed on this one.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">C Tier</h2>



<p><strong>Nidalee</strong>: Overrated in my opinion. Dies to backline infiltration, doesn&#8217;t do enough damage to chew through frontline typically. Can be B tier or even A tier with an item or 2 and a couple Warlord stacks, but kind of meh overall.</p>



<p><strong>Aphelios</strong>: Not the best early game but it&#8217;s not really his job anyway. I usually only pick him up as an Ashe item holder or if I&#8217;m doing the Aphelios comp.</p>



<p><strong>Hecarim</strong>: I really want to like this unit but wow he is BAD. Better than Garen 2 and Wukong 2 at 2 star, worse than both at 1 star, and if I&#8217;m being honest, usually not worth holding the pair.</p>



<p><strong>Teemo</strong>: Underwhelming damage with awkward early game synergies. Sharpshooter can be fine if your frontline is strong enough but dies to sins or Galio immediately usually. Not a great unit IMO.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">D Tier</h2>



<p><strong>Nami</strong>: Fine for the CC but not much else. She&#8217;s basically Zoe with worse synergies. Mage chosen Nami isn&#8217;t the worst for stage 2, but I&#8217;d rather have almost any other chosen.</p>



<p><strong>Jax</strong>: Absolute synergy bot. You could pick up his chosen, but then you&#8217;d be playing chosen Jax. Idk. This guy ain&#8217;t it atm.</p>



<p><strong>Lux</strong>: Synergy bot for chosen Vanguard Wukong usually to enable divine if you can&#8217;t find Jax, or to pair with chosen Dazzler Lissandra. Dazzler is pretty underwhelming early game though, plus you won&#8217;t get much value out of Lux&#8217;s spell with it anyway.</p>



<p><strong>Vayne</strong>: Terrible unit that I avoid playing at all costs. A literal synergy bot in the truest sense of the phrase. I hold 1 on bench in case I want to play Riven but that&#8217;s it usually.</p>



<p><strong>Xin Zhao</strong>: I&#8217;m honestly not sure about this guy because I never play him. I feel like he&#8217;s kind of terrible as he just gets bursted down/stunlocked but maybe his chosen could be ok??? Not sure. I wanna like this guy but I just can&#8217;t justify it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Examples of very strong boards with general positioning:</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="423" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/example-1-1024x423.png" alt="" class="wp-image-431" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/example-1-1024x423.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/example-1-300x124.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/example-1-768x318.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/example-1.png 1127w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Keeper Cultist, strong early game with Janna splashed in. 5th unit can realistically be another Keeper, another 2 starred unit, or a Thresh as well.</figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="390" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/example-2-1024x390.png" alt="" class="wp-image-432" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/example-2-1024x390.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/example-2-300x114.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/example-2-768x293.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/example-2.png 1139w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Divine Wukong with Mystic. If you can&#8217;t find Yuumi that early, you can play 4 Vanguard or just a strong 2 star backliner instead. If it&#8217;s chosen Vanguard Wukong you can play 4 Vanguard (Garen Wukong Thresh) + Janna at 4.</figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="414" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/example-3-1024x414.png" alt="" class="wp-image-433" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/example-3-1024x414.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/example-3-300x121.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/example-3-768x311.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/example-3.png 1127w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Brawler opener is super versatile, put Sunfire Cape on literally anyone as long as they&#8217;re 2 star. With chosen Brawler you can play 4 Brawler + backliner at 4.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final things to say:</h2>



<p>This guide took a really long time to make and honestly I just really hope it has good enough information for how long it is. If you read the whole thing thank you, and I really really do hope it helps. I also do stream over at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitch.tv/inikoiniko">https://twitch.tv/inikoiniko</a>&nbsp;if anyone ever wants to pop by and ask a question or just say hi, or you can just stalk <a href="https://lolchess.gg/profile/na/ttvinikoiniko" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my lolchess</a>. </p>



<p>Lastly, I really want to shout out some cool people:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.twitch.tv/thejirachy" target="_blank">https://www.twitch.tv/thejirachy</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.twitch.tv/garchompro" target="_blank">https://www.twitch.tv/garchompro</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.twitch.tv/clutchinpenguin" target="_blank">https://www.twitch.tv/clutchinpenguin</a></li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/beardsandcats0240"><br>/u/beardsandcats0240</a>&nbsp;who runs a friendly, weekly EU and NA tournament with a small prize pool. This is a really fun experience and any player of any skill level is allowed. He funds it and promotes it all by himself as far as I know, and I play in it weekly. We&#8217;re always looking for more players!</p>



<p>All very good players I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of meeting through various tournaments. Definitely worth checking them all out as I think they&#8217;re underrated and I honestly believe anyone of any skill level can learn from them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I hope this guide helps some of you. There&#8217;s a lot of value in discussion so please, ask questions or criticize me if you don&#8217;t agree with my thought process.

<p>The first competitive games of Set 4 were played yesterday in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0tWGhU5oqc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fight Night Rising</a> &#8211; the longest-running weekly TFT tournament featuring some of the game’s best players.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the Top 4 comps, the most popular 5-cost units, and see how the winners won their games.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Top 4 Compositions</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/top-4-comps-1-edited.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="749" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/top-4-comps-1-edited.png" alt="" class="wp-image-399" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/top-4-comps-1-edited.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/top-4-comps-1-edited-300x187.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/top-4-comps-1-edited-1024x639.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/top-4-comps-1-edited-768x479.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Riven and Ashe comps dominated the tournament </h3>



<p><strong>Riven</strong> is currently one of the strongest units in the game. The Dusk trait helps her dish out a ton of damage and her massive shield keeps her alive for a long time. </p>



<p>Stack her with AP items: Rabadon&#8217;s Deathcap, Ionic Spark, Sunfire Cape, Guardian Angel, etc.  <strong>Jhin is Riven&#8217;s best friend; every time that Dusk made it to Top 4, Jhin was part of the comp</strong>. Jhin with Giant Slayer works great against the tanky brawlers!</p>



<p><strong>Ashe</strong> hides behind the Brawlers and destroys everything! Don&#8217;t forget your Giant Slayer and Quicksilver. </p>



<p>The Elderwood buff makes her even more potent as the fight progresses. Nunu and Sett are the secondary carries in this comp. </p>



<p><strong>A Mage comp had a convincing win in game 3</strong>. A double Jeweled Gauntlet Twisted Fate carried the team with the help of Annie and Ahri. </p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">5-costs in Top 4 comps</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/top-5-costs-edited.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="749" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/top-5-costs-edited.png" alt="" class="wp-image-401" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/top-5-costs-edited.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/top-5-costs-edited-300x187.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/top-5-costs-edited-1024x639.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/top-5-costs-edited-768x479.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sett, Azir, and Zilean were the top picks in Top 4 comps</h3>



<p><strong>Sett was played in 3 of the 4 winning comps.</strong> Ever since the start of Set 4, Sett has been insanely popular! He deals insane AOE damage and is almost guaranteed to get off his skill at least once.</p>



<p>His skill does damage based on max HP value of the slammed unit. <strong>The more HP his victim has, the more it will hurt his pals!</strong> If Sett slams your 3-star Brawler into your backline, you are going to have a bad time.</p>



<p><strong>Azir’s AOE disable can cripple the enemy team and his accompanying Sand Guards protect your carry from enemy units</strong>. He also activates the Keeper buff when played with the very popular Riven.</p>



<p><strong>If Zilean manages to get his spell off, then you can claim your free Guardian Angel on two random units!</strong> This is particularly useful because there are units that can one-shot your carry (Sett, Jhin, Talon, Ahri, Veigar). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="620" height="464" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Oprah-You-Get-A-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-405" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Oprah-You-Get-A-1.jpg 620w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Oprah-You-Get-A-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></figure>



<p>He also helps to reach the Mystic synergy, which is super awesome versus magic-based comps!  </p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Game-winning Comps </h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Game 1</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/54w0zRF.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-1-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-406" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-1-1024x576.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-1-300x169.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-1-768x432.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-1-1536x864.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-1.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p><a href="https://twitch.tv/treebeard/profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Treebeard</a> played an early Cultist Keeper comp, using Jarvan to hold his Riven items. He found a Chosen Spirit Ahri. He played 4 Dusk 2 Sharpshooter with Riven and Jhin as his main carries and topped off his comp with five-cost units: Sett and Azir. He did not play Thresh. He nearly lost to Jinglee’s Zed comp in the final round, but his Ahri tanked Zed and the Spirit Bomb.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Game 2</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/pxTmxx1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-2-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-408" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-2-1024x576.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-2-300x169.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-2-768x432.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-2-1536x864.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-2.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.twitch.tv/thgspencerz" target="_blank">THGSpencerZ</a> played a Cultist opener with Zed holding his Ashe items. He found an early Chosen Brawler Nunu and transitioned into Brawlers. He was able to build an Elderwood spat for his Sett and found another on the carousel. He ended the game on 39 HP and a 12-round win streak. Barry Badden’s Dusk Keeper comp didn’t stand a chance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Game 3</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/KywN3fj.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-3-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-409" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-3-1024x576.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-3-300x169.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-3-768x432.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-3-1536x864.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-3.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.twitch.tv/bkrisz" target="_blank">BKrisz</a> found an early Chosen Mage Twisted Fate and stacked it with double Jeweled Gauntlet. At level 7 he added Yuumi + Janna for Mystic and Spirit and slow-rolled to find his Annie 3. Sphinx’s Warlords were no match for Annie, and Kris won the BKrisz with 34 HP and a 7 win streak.  </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Game 4</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/P1VEGnd.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-4-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-410" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-4-1024x576.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-4-300x169.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-4-768x432.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-4-1536x864.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/game-4.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/barrybadden" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barrybadden</a> played an early Chosen Cultist Elise with Jarvan for Keeper. It eventually became 6 Cultist + Riven. At level 8, he sold his Chosen and rolled down to find a Chosen Dusk Cassiopeia. He added Zilean, Aatrox, and Jhin for the Mystic, Sharpshooter, Vanguard, and Cultists synergies (that&#8217;s a lot of synergies). A last-second Zephyr placement hit Treebeard’s Riven, securing Barry the win.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Dusk Riven feat. Jhin and Ashe Brawler were the strongest comps today, but Mage and Warlord managed to beat them in game three. Dusk and Sett are going to be nerfed in the upcoming patch, so play them while you can! Sett, Azir, and Zilean were the most popular 5-costs. Congrats to Treebeard for winning this week&#8217;s Fight Night! </p>

<p>8 of the top Latin American players battled for 2 spots in the TFT Galaxies World Championship Finals. It was one of the first professional tournaments played post-mech hotfix on patch 10.17.   </p>



<p>A big congrats to <a href="https://twitter.com/HeladodeVaini19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Calcifer</a> and Cupidita who will be representing Latin America in the TFT Galaxies World Championship Finals! Calcifier won 3 of the 4 games played today, and Cupidita went Top 2 in 2 of the games (he also won the first game which was played last week) to join him. </p>



<p>Now let&#8217;s see what comps are trending and what had success, then discover how to play these comps more effectively.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Xayah Shredder comp claimed 2 victories</h2>



<p>LATAM Qualifier winner <a href="https://twitter.com/HeladodeVaini19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Calcifer</a> won 2 games with a 3-star Xayah-powered 6 Blademaster comp. In Game 3, he played <strong>Urgot and 2 Shens to counter a Yi/Zed</strong> Blademaster comp. In Game 4, he added <strong>Mystic (Karma + Lulu) and Thresh to defeat a strong Mech composition</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Astro Sniper to Dark Star transition successful! </h2>



<p>Calcifier played an Astro Sniper comp, then transitioned into a Dark Star comp when he found a Xerath 2. Who would have known that Teemo was just an item holder for Xerath. It was ridiculously strong and he ended the game with 44 HP. <strong>If you&#8217;ve been wondering how to make your Astro Sniper comp stronger, this might be it!</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Viktor&#8217;s Mech + loads of Legendaries crushed a puny Cybernetic comp</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/elpepi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">elpepi</a> received a lot of flak from Twitch chat today, but he also showed us that even with the nerf (hotfix), Mech can still kick butt!

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Iconic Duo: Cybernetic and Chrono</h2>



<p>Cybernetic was the most played comp and the Cybernetic and Chrono traits go together like bread and butter. 7 of the 8 Chrono units enable Cybernetic class synergies: Blademaster, Sniper, Blaster, Brawler, Mana-reaver, and Vanguard. </p>



<p>But which Chrono units are the most important? One unit appeared in 100% of the Cybernetic endgame comps played today. His name&#8230; </p>



<p><strong>Wukong!</strong> This magnificent mighty monkey helps Vayne (the primary Cybernetic carry) stay far away from enemy units and maximize her Sniper bonus. Wukong also provides a much needed AOE disable! </p>



<p><strong>Caitlyn enables the Sniper bonus for Vayne, so she is almost always the second Chrono unit on the board until Thresh shows up</strong>. When that happens, Caitlyn can be replaced with Ashe to increase Cybernetic crowd control capabilities. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Additional Tips for Cybernetic Success</h3>



<ul><li>Prioritize items for Vayne. Infinity Edge, Last Whisper, and Giant Slayer are her best items. Multiple Giant Slayers is an option when you can&#8217;t find other components.</li><li>The best Spatula item/unit combination is Infiltrator Irelia. It lets her reach the squishy carries and enables the Infiltrator trait for Ekko.</li><li>If you make it to level 9, Thresh pulling in strong units (Urgot &gt; Blitz, Janna, Asol, etc.) is probably your best bet for victory.</li><li>Lucian can be your early game carry, and is the item holder for Ekko. Red Buff is his favorite item but Morello can work too.  </li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Let&#8217;s take a look at 6 Star Guardian</h2>



<p>Star Guardian was played a lot today. Here are some key observations:</p>



<ul><li>Prioritize items for Neeko and Syndra. </li><li>Syndra&#8217;s best item is Blue Buff. After that AP items are ideal. The changes to Hextech Gunblade make it a viable option and Giant Slayer can be slammed too. If you can&#8217;t find 2 Tears, Shojin is an alternative.</li><li>Neeko wants tanky items. Warmog&#8217;s almost doubles her HP which makes her Protector shield absorb massive damage. Ionic Spark increases the team&#8217;s overall magic damage input. QSS is important vs disable-heavy lineups and lobbies with a lot of Zephyrs. Guardian Angel is great value because she&#8217;s likely to cast her skill and get a fresh shield.</li><li>Rakan (or Xin) and Lulu are the Star Guardians&#8217; best friends, enabling 3 key synergies: Celestial, Protector, and Mystic.    </li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>A lot of comps are viable. Cybernetic is the most popular, followed by 6 Star Guardian and Astro Sniper. Wukong is a staple in Cybernetic comps and Astro Sniper may be a transitional comp that ends up as Dark Star Vanguard. Also, Battlecast went 4th place in 3 out of 4 games; talk about a Top-4 comp!</p>

<p>Fight Night Rising is a weekly TFT tournament featuring some of the best players in the game. It is also the first competitive event of patch 10.16. <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/702678840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This week&#8217;s tournament</a> included some big names and rising stars. Some interesting Blademaster comp variations were played. Let&#8217;s dive right in!  </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Compositions in the Top 4</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="384" height="128" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/yi-jhin-jinx.png" alt="" class="wp-image-328" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/yi-jhin-jinx.png 384w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/yi-jhin-jinx-300x100.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /></figure></div>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Blademasters claimed 2 victories, Rebels with Gangplank had a convincing win, and a 3-star Ashe Dark Star comp narrowly defeated a strong Mech Infiltrator </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-1-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-345" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-1-1024x576.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-1-300x169.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-1-768x432.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-1-1536x864.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-1.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>Lobby #1</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the first lobby, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/narkeztft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NarkezTFT</a>&#8216;s 6-Rebel Blaster + Gangplank defeated Mismatched Socks&#8217;s Rebel Blademasters. Sock&#8217;s went from 34 to 7, to 0 hp in the final rounds. <strong>The 2-star Legendaries were too much for the 2-star Blademasters</strong>. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-2.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-2-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-346" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-2-1024x576.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-2-300x169.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-2-768x432.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-2-1536x864.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-2.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>Lobby #2</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the second lobby, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/treebeard/videos">Treebeard</a>&#8216;s Shredder-type Blademasters dominated the early game but nearly lost to Wojtek&#8217;s Cybernetics. He managed to outposition Wojtek in the final round and claim the victory. <strong>By the end of the lobby, he had 3-starred 4 units</strong> (Riven included).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-3.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-3-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-347" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-3-1024x576.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-3-300x169.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-3-768x432.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-3-1536x864.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-3.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>Lobby #3</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the third lobby, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/mismatchedsocksss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mismatched Socks</a>&#8216;s added a 2-star Ekko (for the Cybernetic and Infiltrator synergies) to his Rebel Blademaster comp. He had a double-knockout in the final round and ended on 42 HP. I believe the <strong>Red Buff Ekko and the 3-star Shen</strong> had something to do with his success. <em>Side note: he played Blademaster comps in every lobby.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-4.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-4-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-348" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-4-1024x576.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-4-300x169.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-4-768x432.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-4-1536x864.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lobby-4.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>Lobby #4</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the final lobby, Narkez was on 1 HP, but his <strong>3-Star Ashe with Shojin, Deathcap, and Hand of Justice</strong> managed to bring him victory over Woijtek&#8217;s strong Mech Infiltrator comp (featuring Rapidfire Cannon Gangplank). </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There were several Blademaster variations</h2>



<p><strong>Thresh was played in 4 out of the 5 successful Blademaster comps</strong>. His role has not changed, he pulls in Urgot, Janna, Lulu, Soraka, Blitzcrank etc. But wait, there&#8217;s more! Irelia + Thresh = Mana-Reaver synergy!</p>



<p>Common 6-Blademaster variations:</p>



<ul><li>Shredder &#8211; Xayah carry with Jarvan + Rakan</li><li>Master Yi 3</li><li>Rebel+Cybernetic Blademasters &#8211; Ekko and Zed complete the synergies</li><li>Cybernetic Blademasters &#8211; Uses Fizz instead of Zed</li></ul>



<p> <strong>Master Yi 3 appeared 0 times today</strong>. It was heavily contested and the 3-star version was also nerfed in this patch. But Master Yi with RFC feels so good!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hand of Justice was built a lot on carries</h2>



<p>Hand of Justice was recently reworked (buffed) and is now a more viable item option for your comp&#8217;s carry. <strong>Ekko, Jinx, Irelia, Shaco, Gangplank, and even the Mech, had good results with HOJ</strong>. If your carry needs a damage/sustain item, but you only get Tears, HOJ is the answer! Sometimes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ekko is a good unit</h2>



<p>Ekko appeared 6 times in Top 4 comps. He&#8217;s a no-brainer for Cybernetics, but consider him when you need to <strong>strengthen your Rebel Blademaster or Mech Infiltrator comp</strong>. He can also play Dark Star comps alongside Shaco. Ekko likes Red Buff/Morello, Rabadon&#8217;s, Ionic Spark, and HOJ. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Star Guardian and Battlecast were unsuccessful</h2>



<p><strong>Not a single Star Guardian Sorcerer-based comp made it into the Top 4</strong>. It was uncontested every game but only managed to place 5th at best. Reroll Battlecast was played twice; similar results. Not a single person played Mystic Vanguards.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Blademaster-based comps are surging in popularity, but success came from Dark Star and buffed Rebel blaster comps too. Hand of Justice is a good option when you have unwanted Tears. And Ekko is a good endgame unit. Also, Teemo Shrooms cancel Darius&#8217; dunk. Congrats to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/simplywojtek" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wojtek</a> for winning 1st place this week!  </p>

<p>Cloud9&#8217;s TFT tournament is now in the semifinal stage. Today, some of the best TFT players in the NA region battled for spots in the finals. <strong>Composition diversity continues to flourish</strong>, and I like what I see. Let&#8217;s dive in!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Compositions in the Top 4</h2>



<ul><li><strong>3</strong> Cybernetic</li><li><strong>3</strong> Dark Star/Protector/Celestial</li><li><strong>2</strong>&nbsp;Blademaster</li><li><strong>2 </strong>Mech</li><li><strong>2</strong>&nbsp;Brawler/Blaster/Rebel</li><li><strong>1</strong>&nbsp;Astro Sniper </li><li><strong>1</strong> Peeba (Legendary-based)</li><li><strong>1</strong>&nbsp;Star Guardian</li><li><strong>1</strong>&nbsp;Battlecast</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cybernetic was the biggest winner </h2>



<p>Cybernetic was nowhere to be seen in the<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="/teamfight-tactics-tournament-meta-10-15/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Fight Night Rising series</a> yesterday, but today <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.twitch.tv/sleettft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SleetTFT</a> won 2 lobbies with them to secure the top spot. Nice one, Sleet! Note that both wins happened in the Binary Star galaxy. </p>



<p>Cybernetic won 1st and 2nd place in the 3rd lobby, so this comp can definitely support more than one player.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sleettft-vs-saintvicious.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sleettft-vs-saintvicious-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-301" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sleettft-vs-saintvicious-1024x576.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sleettft-vs-saintvicious-300x169.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sleettft-vs-saintvicious-768x432.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sleettft-vs-saintvicious.png 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>Cybernetic&#8217;s playstyle hasn&#8217;t changed much since the addition of Vayne and Urgot, but the recent Irelia and Lucian buffs are worth noting.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Astro Sniper and Peeba had a close fight in the final match   </h2>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.twitch.tv/polt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polt</a> and his Astro Snipers were at 1 HP, but he managed to pick up a Wukong 3 before the final round to grab a win over <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.twitch.tv/cottontailtft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cottontail</a>&#8216;s Peeba (6 2-star Legendaries) comp. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/polt-vs-cottontail-1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/polt-vs-cottontail-1-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-297" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/polt-vs-cottontail-1-1024x576.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/polt-vs-cottontail-1-300x169.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/polt-vs-cottontail-1-768x432.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/polt-vs-cottontail-1.png 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Blademasters are still slicing and dicing</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/saintvicious">Saintvicious</a> handed a Protector spatula to Riven, creating the Ultimate Shield Generator. Blademaster best buds Xayah, Master Yi, Irelia, and Riven carried the team to a win. If you&#8217;re planning to try out this comp, don&#8217;t forget your Rakan or Lulu for the Celestial buff. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveTFT/comments/hwv08u/for_those_interested_in_the_kr_qualifiers_for_tft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blademasters are also seeing more love in the Korean qualifiers</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/saintvicious-vs-grandvice.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/saintvicious-vs-grandvice-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/saintvicious-vs-grandvice-1024x576.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/saintvicious-vs-grandvice-300x169.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/saintvicious-vs-grandvice-768x432.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/saintvicious-vs-grandvice.png 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dark Star is not dead</h2>



<p>3 Dark Star-based comps appeared in the Top 4 using <strong>Jhin and Shaco as the primary carries</strong>, backed up by Celestial Protectors. Mech and Astro Sniper comps also utilized Shaco and Jhin. </p>



<p>It seems like the Dark Star trait has been toned down reasonably and is finding its place in other comps. <strong>Not a single person activated the 6 Dark Star trait</strong>. </p>



<p>Jarvan was spotted twice in Top 4 boards; his reign of terror is over, probably. Jhin and Shaco are seeing more of the spotlight these days. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mech shows up again</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thatsprimal" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">ThatsPRIMAL</a> and M35S managed to pilot their Mechs to 3rd place finishes. They both played <strong>Mech Infiltrator and topped their comps off with Star Guardians and Sorcerers</strong>.</p>



<p>Polt did not have the same success and finished 5th and 6th in his attempts. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.twitch.tv/grandvice8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GrandVice8</a> also played an early Mech, then transitioned into Dark Star Protectors for a 4th place finish.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Battlecast uncontested, snags a 3rd place finish</h2>



<p>All<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kiyoon"> Kiyoon</a> had to do was 3-star his Kog&#8217;maw, Illaoi, and Nocturne and grab a Battlecast spatula. It seems like Battlecast is not a strong contender in the tournament meta so far.  </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Brawler/Blaster/Rebel continues to deliver average results</h2>



<p>Jinx and friends continue to show consistent results. No wins, but hey, a Top 4 is a Top 4. The comp finished a lobby in 3rd and another in 4th.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p><strong>A lot of comps are viable.</strong> Cybernetic was the strongest today. Dark Star units are finding their place in multiple comps. Mech and Rebel/Blaster/Brawler are viable. Blademasters need their 3-star Master Yi or Xayah to carry. Battlecast is not very popular in tournament play.  </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking for <a href="/teamfight-tactics-tournament-meta-10-15/">Guides to Rebel/Blaster/Brawler, Astro Sniper, and Blademaster comps</a>, look no further!</p>



<p>Tune into <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/cloud9">Cloud9&#8217;s Twitch stream</a> tomorrow to watch the second group or to view the today&#8217;s VOD. Unfortunately, I won&#8217;t be able to cover it, I&#8217;ll be camping this week. </p>

<p>Fight Night Rising is a weekly TFT tournament that attracts some of the best players in the game. It is also the first competitive event of the 10.15 patch. Let&#8217;s see what the pros found success with <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLhDH94lN5I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this week&#8217;s tournament</a> and what that means for the meta. I&#8217;ve also included links to relevant comp guides.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="769" height="128" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jinx-teemo-syndra-jhin-cass-yi.png" alt="" class="wp-image-280" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jinx-teemo-syndra-jhin-cass-yi.png 769w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jinx-teemo-syndra-jhin-cass-yi-300x50.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" /></figure></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Compositions in the Top 4 </h2>



<ul><li><strong>3</strong> Astro Sniper</li><li><strong>3</strong> Brawler/Blaster/Rebel</li><li><strong>2</strong> Star Guardian</li><li><strong>2</strong> Vanguard Mystic</li><li><strong>2</strong> Mech + Jhin  </li><li><strong>1</strong> Blademaster</li><li><strong>1</strong> Battlecast</li><li><strong>1</strong> Dark Star</li><li><strong>1</strong> Space Pirate Vanguard Sniper </li></ul>



<p>Cybernetic made an appearance in the first game (an 8th) and was never seen again. However, Cybernetic dominated in <a href="/teamfight-tactics-tournament-meta-nebula-semifinals-group-1/">day 1 of the Nebula Semifinals</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Astro Sniper and Rebel/Blaster/Brawler are hot</h2>



<p>Grab a Blue Buff and Morello for Teemo and give Jhin some AD items (Last Whisper, Infinity Edge, Deathblade, Giant Slayer) and 1 defensive item (Guardian Angel, Trap Claw, Quicksilver Sash).</p>

<p>Get your Jinx online with Red Buff, Infinity Edge, Deathblade, Giant Slayer, and Runaan&#8217;s; then surround her with Rebels and Brawlers. Please read the real guide below, I will not take responsibility for any lost LP. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vanguard Mystic is still a solid contender</h2>



<p>Empower Cassiopeia with Blue Buff and Morello and equip Jayce with Ionic Spark and other Tanky Boi items. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveTFT/comments/ht3173/1014_thatsprimals_guide_to_vanguard_mystics/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here&#8217;s a much better guide from thatsPRIMAL</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mech Pilot is back with a twist</h2>



<p>Both times that Mech Pilot hit Top 4, Jhin and Shaco were present. I wonder if other Dark Star units are viable. Perhaps we&#8217;ll see 6 Dark Star + Mech comps soon (please don&#8217;t). Start off with Ziggs for the Demolitionist buff, then transition to Gangplank if/when you find him. </p>



<p>Finish your comp with Legendaries or splash in Celestial/Sniper with Lulu + Ashe. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Uncontested Star Guardian is strong</h2>



<p>You should try to hit Syndra 3 with Blue Buff. Neeko goes in the front with defensive items (Ionic Spark, Warmog&#8217;s, Guardian Angel). Rakan and Lulu add Protector, Celestial, and Mystic traits. If there are other Star Guardian players in the lobby, prepare to have a rough time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Blademasters gunna Blademaster</h2>



<p>Zed with a Blademaster Spatula is very strong. Combine him with Fizz and you have a Rebel Blademaster Infiltrator; pretty strong stuff! Rapidfire Cannon helps to keep him out of harm&#8217;s way.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveTFT/comments/hpfub8/1014_shredder_20_6bm_xayah_slowroll_jinxedjk/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">6 Blademaster comp from JinxedJK</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Winner</th><th>2nd Place</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Lobby 1</strong>: Star Cluster</td><td>Astro Sniper, Brawler</td><td>4 Brawler, Blaster, Rebel</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lobby 2</strong>: Plunder Planet</td><td>6 Star Guardian</td><td>4 Dark Star</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lobby 3</strong>: Treasure Trove</td><td>6 Blademaster</td><td>6 Rebel, Blaster, Brawler</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lobby 4</strong>: Treasure Trove</td><td>6 Star Guardian</td><td>Astro Snipers, Vanguard</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>There seems to be a healthy variety of viable comps. <strong>Blue buff is a highly contested item: it is core in Astro Sniper, Vanguard Mystic, and Star Guardian compositions. When in doubt, grab the tear. </strong>If you&#8217;re new to TFT and want to learn more, <a href="/5-tips-to-reach-master-rank-in-teamfight-tactics/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">here are some quick tricks that helped me reach Master rank.</a></p>
