It has been uploaded here with the owner&#8217;s permission.  <\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Iniko and I&#8217;ve been challenger in every set so far and have peaked 1k+ LP in set 3 and am currently at my peak rank at rank 5. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been seeing some guides come up recently on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CompetitiveTFT\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this subreddit<\/a> about how to use chosen units and how to play certain comps, but I think something should be said about what units you should look out for early game as well. For this tier list, I&#8217;ve decided to focus on units that I try to play for the strongest board possible. Keep in mind this is also all pre-wolves. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to go in depth here about each unit specifically giving my own little blurb about them. I&#8217;ll also link some example strong board combinations with proper synergies and chosen units. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One disclaimer: Everything here is my own personal opinion on how I see the game. You shouldn&#8217;t take these guides as gospel, but try to coordinate these tips with your own play, and listen to other players as well! I love learning from my peers and I&#8217;ll shout some lesser-known really good players out at the end of this guide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/mRciFF8.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">SSS Tier<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Janna<\/strong>: One of the best units in the entire game I think. I&#8217;m shocked she&#8217;s not getting nerfed as I think she&#8217;s strong at all stages and should only be replaced by Zilean 2 in most comps. Getting an early Janna with a Vanguard, Cultist, Brawler, or chosen Yasuo opener is an instant winstreak. I always take chosen mystic Janna unless I&#8217;m trying to force some meme build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thresh<\/strong>: Also one of the best units at all stages mostly due to his synergies. Extremely flexible unit that you can play in multiple comps with versatile positioning. Early game I like putting my Thresh right behind two stacked frontliners, or right next to my main frontliner so the shield hits 2-3 units. Always pick up an early chosen Thresh. Vanguard lets you go Ahri and Dusk lets you go Riven. I can go more into detail about this kind of decision making in a different guide\/in other comments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">SS Tier<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>J4<\/strong>: Very good coupled with cultist if you have Elise as Keeper is super strong early game and he himself does a surprising amount of damage. Can hold items for Riven.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kindred<\/strong>: Extremely good chosen that can streak you to level 7 or even 8. Even taking 1 cost Kindred isn&#8217;t bad as long as you have items for her, but I probably wouldn&#8217;t play it as 1 cost without items over something like Akali. Can hold Ahri or Ashe items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Akali<\/strong>: Naturally strong with Ninja buff, even better if you get her chosen. Sometimes she gets stuck on units in a weird way so for that reason I think she&#8217;s marginally worse than Kindred, but if she has Blue Buff and an AP item she can streak you really hard, chosen or not. I usually use her to hold Ahri items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nunu<\/strong>: Naturally you&#8217;re most likely going to go Ashe if you find this guy before wolves. Outfit him with tank items. If you aren&#8217;t finding brawlers you can always use him as your Riven.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">S Tier<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pyke<\/strong>: Enables cultist but still very good as a standalone unit. Chosen Pyke assassin is extremely good as is Cultist for obvious reasons. He can hold Ahri items or Jhin items if you get a Dusk spat to put on him early. Also isn&#8217;t bad with Sunfire Cape as he spreads it to everyone, but I like putting that on my beefy boys in the front.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kennen<\/strong>: Obvious choice to pair with Elise in a Cultist comp early game. The only reason he&#8217;s below J4 is that it&#8217;s not as easy to 2 star him and he can often die without ulting. Sticking a GA on him is a great idea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Zed<\/strong>: Pair him with Evelynn and he&#8217;s a monster. Same logic for why he&#8217;s above Eve: easier to 2 star and easier to find his chosen early game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maoki<\/strong>: Extremely tanky when outfitted with Sunfire Cape and 2 starred. Better if chosen. Better if chosen brawler. His spell rules. Not much else to say here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Tier<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elise<\/strong>: Solid frontline unit for cultists, very very good Sunfire Cape holder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diana<\/strong>: Really debated on where to put Diana but I think A tier is fine with her as unless you&#8217;re going moonlight reroll, you&#8217;ll end up selling her chosen anyway. Chosen assassin enables 4 assassin cultist early on which is quite underrated and chosen Moonlight lets you play a myriad of strong boards. She can also solo 1-2 just like in set 2.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Garen<\/strong>: Reliable unit, good with Sunfire Cape and 2 starred, decent overall until mid stage 3 typically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wukong<\/strong>: Divine &gt; Vanguard for chosen. He can hold dps items or tank items for whatever you transition to. I think Bonkey Kong is pretty overrated, but if you want to play it BiS is probably RFC HoJ +1 (maybe QSS\/BT\/IE\/etc. depending on game) Using him with cultist opener bumps him to S tier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yasuo<\/strong>: Extremely strong if chosen, still pretty strong if not. Holds items well just like monkey and you can play quite a few openers around him. My only issue with him is he baits people into going for duelist slowroll which I don&#8217;t think is very good. Use him as an item holder and you&#8217;re solid. Same with monkey, using him with a cultist opener bumps him up to S tier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tahm Kench<\/strong>: UNLOAD THE TOAD OSFrog UNBENCH THE KENCH OSFrog (really good as a solo tank even, Sunfire Cape Kench will outdps your carries, chosen brawler Kench owns. Not higher because without Sunfire he&#8217;s kind of just a sponge.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vi<\/strong>: Heavily underrated unit in my opinion. Vi 2\/Chosen Vi can hold any items and if she doesn&#8217;t winstreak you, you won&#8217;t ever take much damage. I like Brawler Vi more than Warlord Vi for chosen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">B Tier<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lissandra<\/strong>: Can streak you pretty hard with chosen moonlight for a free 3 cost or just plain strong board, pretty underwhelming otherwise IMO until she has a mana\/AP item. Can hold items for Ahri really well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kat<\/strong>: Pretty heckin good if you can get her to cast ever. She&#8217;s cleanup crew for a tanky team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eve<\/strong>: Not a bad unit by any means but I usually use her as a synergy bot and if she gets more than 1 kill I&#8217;m happy. Power goes way up at 2 stars though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sylas<\/strong>: Beefy frontline Moonlight dude man guy. Up so high because his spell is really good and enables a few strong boards with Brawler or Moonlight options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lulu<\/strong>: Also debated on this one but she can definitely have some clutch moments with an early Elderwood synergy coupled with her spell. Not a bad unit but I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d pick her up as chosen unless I was playing some mage meme comp, and even then it&#8217;s a maybe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jinx<\/strong>: Enables sharpshooter, solid stun, if you get her early she&#8217;s eh. Give her Shojin and it&#8217;s better. Her chosen can streak you with items but I haven&#8217;t seen it do much without items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fiora<\/strong>: Heavily underrated unit, I will unironically consider picking up a chosen Fiora and having her hold items. Only in B tier because you never want to keep her and her synergies don&#8217;t enable much but as a standalone unit she&#8217;s pretty good at 2 star. Stop calling her garbage \ud83d\ude41<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Annie<\/strong>: Can definitely fit into an already strong comp if you roll her as your chosen. I wouldn&#8217;t really play her otherwise, but she&#8217;s not the worst by any means. Give her Riven items or try to 3 star her for some fun (8th place) gameplay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Twisted Fate<\/strong> (I think?): Obvious choice for cultists, 2 star does some great damage, overall just solid reliable unit. Give him Ahri items. Seriously could not tell if this image was Jhin or TF.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yuumi<\/strong>: The absolute GOD CARRY later in the game for many comps. Seriously don&#8217;t underestimate this cat. I like her early game for mystic paired with Janna, plus her spell owns. In other situations, she is a bit underwhelming until later though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Irelia<\/strong>: Not the worst but not the best. Even getting her as chosen is kind of&#8230; meh. She can probably streak you but I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s worth the investment because of the synergies. Open to having my mind changed on this one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">C Tier<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nidalee<\/strong>: Overrated in my opinion. Dies to backline infiltration, doesn&#8217;t do enough damage to chew through frontline typically. Can be B tier or even A tier with an item or 2 and a couple Warlord stacks, but kind of meh overall.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aphelios<\/strong>: Not the best early game but it&#8217;s not really his job anyway. I usually only pick him up as an Ashe item holder or if I&#8217;m doing the Aphelios comp.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hecarim<\/strong>: I really want to like this unit but wow he is BAD. Better than Garen 2 and Wukong 2 at 2 star, worse than both at 1 star, and if I&#8217;m being honest, usually not worth holding the pair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Teemo<\/strong>: Underwhelming damage with awkward early game synergies. Sharpshooter can be fine if your frontline is strong enough but dies to sins or Galio immediately usually. Not a great unit IMO.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">D Tier<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nami<\/strong>: Fine for the CC but not much else. She&#8217;s basically Zoe with worse synergies. Mage chosen Nami isn&#8217;t the worst for stage 2, but I&#8217;d rather have almost any other chosen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jax<\/strong>: Absolute synergy bot. You could pick up his chosen, but then you&#8217;d be playing chosen Jax. Idk. This guy ain&#8217;t it atm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lux<\/strong>: Synergy bot for chosen Vanguard Wukong usually to enable divine if you can&#8217;t find Jax, or to pair with chosen Dazzler Lissandra. Dazzler is pretty underwhelming early game though, plus you won&#8217;t get much value out of Lux&#8217;s spell with it anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vayne<\/strong>: Terrible unit that I avoid playing at all costs. A literal synergy bot in the truest sense of the phrase. I hold 1 on bench in case I want to play Riven but that&#8217;s it usually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Xin Zhao<\/strong>: I&#8217;m honestly not sure about this guy because I never play him. I feel like he&#8217;s kind of terrible as he just gets bursted down\/stunlocked but maybe his chosen could be ok??? Not sure. I wanna like this guy but I just can&#8217;t justify it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Examples of very strong boards with general positioning:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"423\" src=\"https:\/\/sitegrammar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/example-1-1024x423.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-431\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sitegrammar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/example-1-1024x423.png 1024w, https:\/\/sitegrammar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/example-1-300x124.png 300w, https:\/\/sitegrammar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/example-1-768x318.png 768w, https:\/\/sitegrammar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/example-1.png 1127w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Keeper Cultist, strong early game with Janna splashed in. 5th unit can realistically be another Keeper, another 2 starred unit, or a Thresh as well.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"390\" src=\"https:\/\/sitegrammar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/example-2-1024x390.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-432\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sitegrammar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/example-2-1024x390.png 1024w, https:\/\/sitegrammar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/example-2-300x114.png 300w, https:\/\/sitegrammar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/example-2-768x293.png 768w, https:\/\/sitegrammar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/example-2.png 1139w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Divine Wukong with Mystic.
